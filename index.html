1. Convert all <div> tags to semantic html tags.
2. Think carefully about where to place the

                    <p><strong>At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value!</strong></p>
                    <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a 
                        great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic 
                        value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT 
                        bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. 
                        Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by 
                        this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk 
                        (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a 
                        total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS 
                        Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text 
                        on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.</p>

                        them, not buying them.</p>
